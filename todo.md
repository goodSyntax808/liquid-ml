- Random Forest LUL
 - script to add features, convert csv to sor, label the data
 - write the algorithm
- clean up
- application + dataframe layer documentation/update memo
- add back function that builds from sor and assumes file is on every node
- Testing (esp would be good around chunking to ensure no off by one errors)
- investigate if we should use `tokio::spawn_blocking` anywhere
